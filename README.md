Craig's Portfolio Website


##TARGET AUDIENCE

the target audience for this website can be broken down into 3 categories. age based, type of people and the likely professions these people will have.

the age ranged targeted for this website is 25 to 60 year olds. this is a broad range to target as it is multi generational range and the main problem with targeting such a huge range is the people and the extreme edges of this range will have a different idea on how a website should look. the higher end of the range will be expecting a more traditional page that they would have seen many times before over the years where at the polar opposite side of the range they are looking for a trendy page or the in style page that not only looks good but also links into there digital identity.

The type of people this website tries to target are professional people. As the main focus of this website is to provide evidence of the subject abilities and brief personality traits; trying to please all demographics would be an impossible feat so targeting a user base of people who are in professional roles reduces the white noise needed for the website.

By targeting professional people the subject is not only trying to project an image of “i am a professional too” but trying to appeal to that demographic so future professional opportunities can be unlocked or new networking opportunities can be achieved.


Finally the focused professions this website tries to target are business, human resources and the technology sector. These professions are targeted based on the subjects idea that these are the most common professions that will be looking at this website.

Now we have taken the time to identify who this website is aimed for we can now start planning design and content.


##WEBSITE PLAN

Taking in the knowledge of who the target audience is and what the subject is trying to achieve with this website we have decided to go with the following design ideas.

1. to do a single page website where the user glides through the page with minimal effort.
2. to keep content short to maximise impact and to “stick” in users mind.
3. to theme the website in boring unimpressionable colours to make the content stand out for the user to easily digest.
4. to position the content that the users eye naturally flows through the content without the need to search for the important content.
5. to break the site up into sections so the user can at a glance expect what type of information to expect.
6. mobile friendly site so the subject can use it in his elevator pitch.

so with all those ideas we came up with the following design choice.
![iphone 5 mockup](https://c-lockwood.github.io/images/iPhone 5SE.svg "Iphone 5 mockup")

![desktop mockup](https://c-lockwood.github.io/images/Web 1366 – 1.svg "Desktop Mockup")

Using the adobe kuler we uploaded the hero image and got a color scheme that fits number 3 and complements our hero image.

NOTE: this was not the first design mocked up as the first design has a more adventure / nature look to it but it fell more into the category of what the subjected liked not what the target audience would like. check out the original mockup [here](https://c-lockwood.github.io/images/first_mockup.svg).

##BREAKDOWN OF MOCKUP
###Hero Section
the hero section has a cover photo of the subject (where we got our color scheme) with a heading element at the top of the page (or top left depending on screen size) and 2 text boxes on the lower right of the centre of the page.

this section was layed out in this way to get the user to scan through the section in the same fashion as if they were glancing at a news paper.

the 2 boxes are skewed by 7 degrees as a trend in 2017 is to have uncommon angles.

###Skills Section
the skills section has a grey background with the section title in the top centre followed by a list of skills.
we did this to highlight the information in this section for the user and make the information easily digestible.
depending on screen size they are either lined up horizontally or vertically

###Projects Section
the projects section is done in a similar design to the skills section with 2 differences. firstly the image icons are animated images so that the user can get a glance on what the project was without making the user leave the page to look at the project and secondly the background is a browny sand image so to indicate to the user that this section with the background image is the project section and provides a clear start and end point of the section.

###About Section
the about section is styled with a dark blue picture of the subject to the left of the section with a brief write up about the subject on the right side of the section. this was done on purpose to make the user see the title and then the image of the subject then notice the text and hopefully read it (as it is larger then any other text on the site)

###Contact Section
the contact section is styled with a background image of a coffee cup and a mobile phone in a cafe location. the intention is to plant the idea that catching up in person for a coffee is an option with out explicitly saying it.

the contact section has a built in form so people can email the subject without the need to use their own email client. by this stage if the user has navigated through the page at this point they will be deciding if they are going to contact so this is likely the main point that the user will leave the site.
###Footer Section
the footer section is just a basic brown color that has white icons to other links about the subjects social presence. this section is basicly just an extra for the user to find out more information about the subject.


##BUILDING THE WEBSITE
This website was created with a mobile first approach which means it has been created for mobile devices and when a larger screen device is used (AKA a tablet or desktop) the website can responsively resize to accommodate the new resolution.

A block structure approach was taken when building this website, this means the website was built by section to insure isolation when errors were created.
